# OnBoard - Frontend

## About

This is my capstone project for college.
I have seperated it out into 3 repositories so as to prevent a clutter of files.

[capstone-client, capstone-server, capstone-test]

The client and server are the frontend and backend respectively,
and each may hold some unit tests solely applicable to the scope of that component.

Any tests involving both the frontend and the backend will be located in the tests repo.

Documentation - mockups, ERD, class diagrams are currently in my private DropBox.

They may be moved into their own repo at the end of this to showcase all parts of this project.

## Areas of Focus

-   React
-   Redux
-   TypeScript
-   CI/CD
-   AWS (S3, ACM, CloudFront, Route53, CodePipeline, CodeBuild)

## Environment

-   Just rely on NODE_ENV to dictate what to use as any environment variables used will be visible client side
